This sample demonstrates multiple things, namely -
- Running OMRChecker on images scanned using popular document scanning apps
- Using a common template.json file for sub-folders (e.g. multiple scan batches)
- Using evaluation.json file with custom marking
- The example implements complex marking schemes like that of [Technothlon 2019](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BhjgHgAItq305B6nKwGJE5bde-SOAdln/view) question paper
