# **Codebase Documentation Generator**

This mini-project is part of the larger [OMRChecker](https://github.com/your-username/OMRChecker) codebase. It provides a **Streamlit-based dashboard** to automatically generate comments and documentation for Python code files using **Google Gemini** (via LangChain). The tool helps improve code readability and maintainability by adding meaningful comments and generating detailed documentation.

---

## **Features**
- **Automated Commenting**: Adds clear and concise comments to Python code files.
- **Documentation Generation**: Creates a detailed documentation wiki for the codebase.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and interactive experience.
- **No Code Changes**: Ensures the original code logic remains unchanged.
- **Change Tracking**: Displays a diff of changes before applying them.

---

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
1. **Python 3.8+**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. **Google API Key**: Obtain a Google API key with access to the Gemini API.
3. **Git**: Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OMRChecker.git
   cd OMRChecker/codebase-docgen
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## **Usage**

### **Running the Dashboard**
1. Start the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3. Enter your **Google API Key** in the input box.

4. Upload one or more Python files using the file uploader.

5. Review the generated comments and documentation. If satisfied, click **Apply Changes** to save the updates.

## **How It Works**
1. **User Input**:
   - The user provides a Google API key and uploads Python files.

2. **Comment and Documentation Generation**:
   - The app uses **Google Gemini** (via LangChain) to analyze the code and generate comments and documentation.

3. **Change Tracking**:
   - The app displays a diff of the changes using `difflib`.

4. **User Confirmation**:
   - The user can review the changes and choose to apply them.

5. **Save Changes**:
   - Applied changes are saved to the file and stored in the `saved_changes/` folder.

---

## **Dependencies**
- **Streamlit**: For the web-based dashboard.
- **LangChain**: For integrating with Google Gemini.
- **Google Generative AI**: For accessing the Gemini API.
- **Difflib**: For tracking and displaying changes.
